# Day 01 - Introduction to Python

This session introduces the foundational concepts of Python programming, aimed at beginners. Through a series of interactive Jupyter notebooks, participants are guided through Python syntax, data types, and basic programming constructs.

## Key Learning Objectives:
- **Understand Basic Python Syntax**: Familiarize with the Python programming environment and understand the syntax that makes up Python code.
- **Learn Python Data Types**: Gain knowledge about Python's built-in data types, including numbers, strings, boolean values, lists, and dictionaries, and how to use them.
- **Operate with Python Operators**: Learn how to use relational and bitwise operators to perform calculations and data manipulations.
- **Handle User Input**: Master techniques for accepting user input and processing it for various programming needs.
- **Work with Arrays**: Understand how to create, manipulate, and access arrays in Python, providing a foundation for data structure management.


## Main Topics Covered:
- **Python Statements and Expressions**: Introduction to the basic components of Python programming, including variables, expressions, and statements.
- **Data Types**: Exploration of Python's core data types with a focus on numbers (integers, floating-point, and complex numbers), strings, boolean values, lists, and dictionaries.
- **Operators**: Overview of relational and bitwise operators, demonstrating how to perform comparisons and manipulate data at the binary level.
- **User Input and Evaluation**: Techniques for accepting user inputs via the `input()` function and processing these inputs using `eval()`.
- **Arrays**: Introduction to array-like data structures in Python, highlighting methods for creation, manipulation, and access.

## Practical Examples:
Each concept is reinforced with practical code examples, allowing participants to see Python syntax and constructs in action. The notebook includes examples of:
- Performing arithmetic and logical operations.
- Manipulating strings and understanding their properties.
- Accepting and processing user inputs.
- Working with arrays to store and manipulate collections of data.


## Libraries and Datasets:
The first day's content focuses on core Python functionality without the introduction of external libraries or datasets. This foundational knowledge sets the stage for more advanced topics in subsequent sessions.

This summary encapsulates the key learning objectives and content covered, serving as an introductory guide for participants and a reference for revisiting the basics of Python programming.
